## Font

I used a patched version (using the font-patcher from [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)) of [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com) to include icons that the font does not include normally.

Due to the license restrictions for the Input font, I cannot distribute the font files here. However, you can follow the steps here to download and create the font:
